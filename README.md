Which factors contribute to customer satisfaction the most? What about dissatisfaction?


[Impact Sizing] What's the percentage of customers that are dissatified or satisfied with our services and also the percentage of customers that joined, churned or repeating?


[External] Are there any new competitiors that launched in the market or did an existing competitor roll out a new feature or offering?


[Demographic] What's the age group that we are seeing the most dissatification from, what's the percentage of them churning and what's making them chose our competitors?


[Metric Breakdown] There are levers that's affect the growth of the company: new users, repeating users and churned users. Are we seeing fewer new and repeating users comning in or are we seeing more users churning out?



➡️ First, understanding the percentage of the customers that churned from the airlines company helps indicate the amount of customers lost. Also, the company needs to analyze the repeating and customers that just joined and observe their dissatification/satification. Are the repeating and new customers that dissatisfied having the same problems with the company.

➡️ Second, there could be new competitors that launched in the market or possibly a existing competitor that rolled out a new feauture or offering that's causing the company to potentially use high value customers. If this is the case we can study the competitors new feauture and find ways to duplicate it but make improvements.

➡️ Third, identifying the demographic profile of the customers who have churned and had dissatisfaction with the company's service will help the company understand the target market that needs to be focused on. Is the serivce the company provides applicable to their needs.

➡️ Fourth, is the company growing or is it declining.
